          | I started my career as a filmmaker and digital producer. I worked with non-profit organizations and media companies to produce short-form video content. I picked up some HTML and CSS and soon found myself falling in love with making digital products on the web. 
          | I decided the best thing to do for my new passion was to go back to school. I graduated from 
          a(href="https://www.soic.indiana.edu/", target="_blank") Indiana University's iSchool 
          | in 2013 and I've worked with technology companies ever since.
        p 
          | Right now, I'm a Sr. UX Designer at 
          a(href="http://sharethrough.com", target="_blank") Sharethrough 
          | where I help publishers like CNN, Warner Bros, Forbes, and Rollingstone manage their native advertising revenue.
          
        p I'm an advocate for Lean Startup practicesâ€”understanding assumptions and conducting experiments to discover if the assumptions are real.
