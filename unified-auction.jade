        h3 Background
        p 
          | One of the most popular advertising channels is called programmatic. With this method, publishers can connect their inventory to hundreds of advertisers who bid in real-time (using the 
          a(href="https://www.iab.com/guidelines/real-time-bidding-rtb-project/", "_target") RTB protocol
          |). Sharethrough's exchange offers this kind of real-time bidding for our publishers and it's the basis for our business. We take a share of the revenue that publishers make from this exchange.
        h3 The Problem
        p 
          | Despite the efficiencies promised by programmatic and real-time bidding, standard open auctions leave a lot of money on the table.
          
        blockquote 
          p Programmatic advertising seeks to make digital advertising more efficient by leveraging real-time data in order to reach consumers with the most relevant message at the best time.

          | This is true for advertisers; not so much for publishers. In many programmatic channels, publishers' inventory is suffers from 
          a(href="http://www.bannerconnect.net/first-price-second-price-auction-mechanics/", target="_blank") price reduction
          |  and waterfalls can prevent the advertiser willing to pay the most for the impression to lose out to a lower bid.
        p The other limitation with this style of programmatic selling is that you lose opportunities to monetize from other exchanges or networks. The way that publishers have to configure their ad units is using a "waterfall"â€”or a daisy-chained list of channels that can only compete when the previous channel has passed on the bid.

        span.caption This is how a typical RTB impression works with Sharethrough. Notice how the winning price is a lot less than the highest bid. This is the second price auction at work.

        h3 Discovery
        p So given these problems, how can we reduce price reduction and have more exchanges compete to raise prices? Our approach: header bidding. Header bidding allows publishers to connect several exchanges to bid at the same time before the page has fully loaded. 
        p My team started this project by interviewing dozens of publishers about header bidding and how they were integrating technology to enable it. Through these interviews, we learned that the biggest pain points with head bidder were:
        ul
          li Ad server setup. Most header bidding services require a lot of laborious setup.
          li Technical bidder management. To add or remove bidders requires pubs manually write special javascript code on each page. Most ad ops teams aren't equipped to do this.
          li Poor Reporting. Most header bidding solutions do not offer meaning reporting, specifically visibility into bidder performance.

        h3 Solution
        p Header bidding changed a lot about how we think about inventory and how we report on it. An impression in this new world was a bit more nuanced. So in order to understand this world better, I needed to model it.

        span.caption Here we can see three separate exchanges (the teal, blue, and green bands) are able to bid at the same time. There's still price reduction, but we can see that it's not as dramatic as the auction above.

        span.caption This diagram is modeling the "scopes of reporting". We want to report on the auction as a whole (which we code named Microscope) and with the Sharethrough Exchange (STX) as a bidder. This diagram helped us understand how to structure our reporting.
