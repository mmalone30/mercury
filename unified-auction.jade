        h3 Background
        p 
          | One of the most popular advertising channels is called programmatic. With this method, publishers can connect their inventory to hundreds of advertisers who bid in real-time (using the 
          a(href="https://www.iab.com/guidelines/real-time-bidding-rtb-project/", "_target") RTB protocol
          |). Sharethrough's exchange offers this kind of real-time bidding for our publishers and it's the basis for our business. We take a share of the revenue that publishers make from this exchange.
        p Within this real-time bidding channel, you can create a "waterfall"—a daisy-chain of networks and exchanges to sell your inventory. This method has a lot of inefficiences because in order for a buyer to get a chance to bid on the impression, the previous buyer must pass on that impression. This means the buyer out there with the highest bid might not win. 
        p 
          | This is where 
          a(href="https://digiday.com/media/wtf-header-bidding/", target="_blank") header bidding 
          | comes into play. With this strategy, you connect multiple bidders and they all complete on the same impression before a webpage has loaded. This means the publisher has a better chance at getting the highest possible bid.
        p Given certain market dynamics and customer development done in 2016, it seemed like a good idea for Sharethrough to redesign how it's RTB, open auction product worked. We wanted to deliver a unified auction with less waste for publishers.
        h3 The Problem
        p When it comes to unified auctions and header bidding, we identified these problems:

            | Most header bidding services require a lot of laborious setup in the ad server. How can we have software automate this rote task?

            strong Technical bidder management. 
            | To add or remove bidders requires pubs manually write special javascript code on each page. Most ad ops teams aren't equipped to do this. How can we provide an easy-to-use UI so publishers can manage bidders?
          li 
            strong Poor Reporting. 
            | Most header bidding solutions do not offer meaning reporting, specifically visibility into bidder performance. How can we tell a good story of header bidder performance?

        h3 Discovery
        p So given these problems, how can we reduce price reduction and have more exchanges compete to raise prices? Our approach: a unified auction via header bidding. Header bidding allows publishers to connect several exchanges to bid at the same time before the page has fully loaded. 
        p My team started this project by interviewing dozens of publishers about header bidding and how they were integrating technology to enable it. Through these interviews, we learned that the biggest pain points with head bidder were:

        h3 Solution
        p Header bidding changed a lot about how we think about inventory and how we report on it. An impression in this new world was a bit more nuanced. So in order to understand this world better, I needed to model it.

        span.caption Here we can see three separate exchanges (the teal, blue, and green bands) are able to bid at the same time. There's still price reduction, but we can see that it's not as dramatic as the auction above.

        span.caption This diagram is modeling the "scopes of reporting". We want to report on the auction as a whole (which we code named Microscope) and with the Sharethrough Exchange (STX) as a bidder. This diagram helped us understand how to structure our reporting.

      .col-2
        span.caption If we were to deliver a unified auction, we would need to deliver unified reporting. A big problem we discovered is poor reporting with header bidding solutions. So I rearchitected the product around the placement—the atomic unit of a publisher's revenue. With this view, it's easy to get a holistic look at how you're making money.

        h3 Outcome
        p As of June 2017, our first unified auction product was released and getting some good traction. The best thing we hear from publishers is how easy the setup experience is compared to other header bidding/unified auction vendors.
